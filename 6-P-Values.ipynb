    "# P-Values\n",
    "We have discussed how a hypothesis test is used to determine the validity of a null hypothesis. A hypothesis test provides a numerical answer, called a p-value, that helps us decide how confident we can be in the result. In this context, a *p-value* is the probability that we yield the observed statistics under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "A p-value of 0.05 means that if the null hypothesis is true, there is a 5% chance that an observed sample statistic could have occurred due to random sampling error. For example, in comparing two sample means, a p-value of 0.05 indicates there is a 5% chance that the observed difference in sample means occurred by random chance, even though the population means are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before conducting a hypothesis test, we determine the necessary threshold we would need before concluding that the results are significant. A higher threshold is more likely to give a *false positive* so if we want to be very sure that the result is not due to just chance, we will select a very small threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that we choose the significance level before we perform our statistical hypothesis tests to yield a p-value. If we wait until after we see the results, we might pick our threshold such that we get the result we want to see. For instance, if weâ€™re trying to publish our results, we might set a significance level that makes our results seem statistically significant. Choosing our significance level in advance helps keep us honest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we want a p-value of less than 0.05, meaning that there is less than a 5% chance that our results are due to random chance."
